## 10/5/2025 - Intro, Research, A few Mockups  

# Oct 4 2025
## My Inspiration
So for a long time, I've tried many digital systems like Notion. But nothing actually kept me productive **consistently**. Can't be a better time to fix that no? So that's why I decided I want to build a device that sits on your desk acting as a personal assistant. An all-in-one device, a featureful digital clock that does more than time, etc. I can keep yapping.
**TL;DR** I want to build a device with a good minimalistic UI/UX to improve productivity

## Initial Research
I want everything to be custom/personal: like boot up experience, etc. There's two options for that...either I could build a custom OS or build a custom OS Shell. Hmmm...What should I do...?

Well I considered both options...Here's why I'm going for the latter.
With a Custom OS, I get...
- Instant bootup
- Premium feel
- all CPU/GPU goes to deksOS<br></br>
But...
- I'll need to handle drivers manually (WiFi, display, input)
- Harder to debug
- AI models or cloud features may be tougher to run unless I build a small bg linux subsystem
- App extensibility would be more complex (prolly don't understand now, more on this later)
**So for MVP I'm going with a custom OS Shell**

## Predicted Components
- 1 x 7" touchscreen (display/input)
- 1 x PI (brain of project)
- ? x mic/amps (audio/input)
- ? x buttons (input)
- 1 x 5-way joystick (backup navigation)
- 2-3 x LED's (for status)
- 1 x ambient light sens (turn screen red or smth when dark)
- ... above is js stuff I could think of, def need more cleansing

## UI Mockups
